## Frontend technologies used:

- HTML/CSS/JS
- React (Framework)
- Netlify (Deployment)

## Frontend known issues:

- On a full movie/tvshow page- directing to another title doesn't happen correctly, the id is put into the URL but the component doesn't re-render.

- I want to resize the primary posters on the full info card, have to mess with the API config.

- 404 Page not working on an invalid URL

- ~~Need to add placeholder posters for cards, instead of just the minicards.~~

- ~~Need to make titles/characters flow to a second or third line instead of just making the card expand super wide.~~
